 * Unit + integration tests for the server-side policy layer (task 19).

 * Playwright owns the full-stack journey tests in `e2e/`; this suite covers
 * the pure logic and the route handlers with Prisma and `fetch` mocked, so a
 * contributor gets a sub-second signal without booting Postgres or two Next
 * servers.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:unit` (coverage: `npm run test:unit:coverage`)
